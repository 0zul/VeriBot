# VeriBot
VeriBot: A discord bot used to verify users and to protect discord servers from raiders and spammers including spam bots. This bot acts like what it does on social medias: Gives you a check mark at the end of your username in a server. But this bot also does add verified users to "verified" role (if it's set'). â€‹
